# Fuzzy Systems
Fuzzy Systems projects during 2018 academic season for ECE AUTH.

## Group 1
#### Control speed of a table's mechanism using Fuzzy Controllers

* Theoretical implementation of the linear controller
* Implementation of the fuzzy controller in Simulink
* Design of the rule base and the membership functions
* Implementation of the Center Of Sums (COS) defuzzification method
* Use of the previous to simulate two different scenarios


## Group 2
#### Car control

* Implementation of a Fuzzy Logical Controller to control a car's movement in order to avoid obstacles
* Design the rule base and the membership functions

## Group 3
#### Regression

* Use of the [CCPP dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant) and the [Bank dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
* Create different TSK models that are using the hybrid method for training (Backpropagation and Least Squares Method)
* Use the Relieff algorithm to choose the most suitable features for training
* Compare metrics between models to find the best fit

## Group 4
#### Classification

* Use of the [Wifi Localization dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wireless+Indoor+Localization) and the [Waveform Generation Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/waveform+database+generator+(version+2))
* Data pre-processing
* Create different TSK models that are using the hybrid method for training (Backpropagation and Least Squares Method)
* Use the Relieff algorithm to choose the most suitable features for training
* Compare metrics between models to find the best fit
